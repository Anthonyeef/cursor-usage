## Project Organization

### Documentation Structure

All markdown documentation files must be placed in the `docs/` folder, **except** for `README.md` which should remain in the project root.

When creating new documentation:
- Place it in `docs/` directory
- Only `README.md` stays at the root level
- This keeps the repository root clean and documentation organized
